## General info
There are a few fence editing tools on the Unity Asset Store, but no free ones. Creating a simple tool to lay out some objects in a line seemed like a good learning opportunity. The tool now has a fully functional editor for visually dropping in, moving and deleting waypoints. The most complicated feature is the shear transform optionally applied to fences to map them over uneven terrains.

## Setup
Tested on Unity 2017.1 and Unity 2019.3. There are two sub-folders for different Unity versions (2019.1 and above, or earlier) which contain different demo scenes, but the code is now the same between them. I aim to unify the versions again when time allows, and add both demo scenes to a single version.

* Simply drag the PolygonPi directory into your Unity project.
* Alternatively download from the Unity Asset Store: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/fence-layout-tool-162856

## Usage
See the video tutorial: https://youtu.be/vT0lnwtPz3o
Or full documentation is included in the package: /PolygonPi/FenceLayout/UserManual.rtf

## Features
* Click and drag editing of waypoints
* Shearing so fences map smoothly to underlying terrain
* Extra position / rotation / scale randomisation options for objects (e.g. trees)
* Random selection from multiple object prefabs (not fences)

## Status
Version 1.1 is complete and available on the Unity Asset Store.
